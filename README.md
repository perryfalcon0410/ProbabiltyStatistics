# Probabilty & Statistics assignment
The assignment is to make the hypothesis and prove that the hypothesis is rejected or not.

## Activity 1
Using ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test to prove there is a different in the mean weight of chickens that are feed different chicken feeds with 95% confidence.

The outcome of Kruskal-Wallis test with 95% confident level

We see that the p-value is less than 0.05 so we have evidence to prove there is a different in the mean weight of chickens that are feed different chicken feeds.

## Activity 2
Using ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test to prove there exists a relationship between the game genre and total sales with 95% confidence.

### Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings

This is a dataset about video game sales. In this dataset, we only use Global_Sales and Genre column to make the dataset clearer and easier to work with.

As the p-value is more than the significance level (0.9921>0.05), we do not have enough evidence to conclude that there is significant difference between the average sales of different gameâ€™s genres.
